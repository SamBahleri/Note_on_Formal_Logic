## 1. Contextual Meaning

On one hand, formal logic is precise in systematically expressing sentences. On the other hand, it tends to flatten nuance into rigid structures, and as a result, it lacks the richness and flexibility inherent in natural language.

Consider the following syllogistic reasoning:

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{All foxes are carnivores} \\
\text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{King Herod is a fox} \\
\text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, King Herod is a carnivore}
\end{aligned}
$

In syllogistic reasoning, the form is clearly valid, but the content is not. Here, formal reasoning, especially when translated into symbols, offers precision in structure, but it does not capture the semantic or contextual dimension. Specifically, in this case, Jesus metaphorically referred to King Herod as a “fox”. The statement was meant as a figurative critique rather than a literal claim, which formal logic cannot fully represent. In this case, formal logic operates in only one dimension, it captures structural validity but fails to account for meaning, context, or figurative nuance.

Moreover, consider the formula:

$$
\forall x \, (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))
$$

This is valid in first-order logic, but the interpretation of $x$ and the predicates $P$ and $Q$ is context-dependent.

## 2. Vagueness

Natural language is full of vague terms, such as “some,” “soon,” and “enough.” Classical logic, however, cannot naturally capture this vagueness because it requires precision. When we make these terms precise, we lose part of the expressive subtlety that makes language rich. For example, if we try to formalize “enough” in classical logic, we might define it as a quantity greater than or equal to a specific threshold $x$. But in natural language, “enough” is context-dependent, enough food for one person might not be enough for others. Forcing precision in this way risks losing the flexibility and adaptability that give language its nuance.

## 3. Presuppositions

Consider definite descriptions, although formal logic can represent the underlying intuitions, it may produce interpretations that differ from human intentions. This double-layered meaning is difficult to capture fully within a formal system. Yet at the same time, we also claim that, for our formal reasoning to remain pure, the logic must not depend on agents or subjectivity.

## 4. Idiomatic Layer

Similarly, formal logic is precise but cannot capture the idiomatic expressions, which often carry non-literal meanings.

For example:

$$\text{“Rain cat and dog”}$$

A formal translation can interpret this syntactically, but it cannot capture the real-world meaning, that it is raining heavily, without extra context.

## 5. Naturalness

Natural language is rich, flexible, and expressive, but also messy. Formal logic, by contrast, is precise but brittle. Yet, the key point is that natural language, despite being abstract, conveys subtleties and nuances that formal logic often cannot.

For example, consider the sentence:

$$\text{“Every student who studies hard will likely succeed.”}$$

A formal translation might be:

$$
\forall x \, (\text{Student}(x) \wedge \text{StudiesHard}(x) \rightarrow \text{Succeeds}(x))
$$

This captures the syntactic structure and a strict logical relation. However, the original sentence conveys probabilistic nuance  and contextual subtleties that the formal statement ignores, showing that natural language expresses meaning beyond strict logical forms.
