## 1. Etymology and Terminology

Normally, in the study of logic, the first thing we need to understand is the question: what is logic in terms of its definition? Etymologically, the word logic comes from the Greek word λόγος (logos). The word logos carries various meanings, including “word,” “speech,” “reason,” “explanation,” and “principle.” Over time, this term was adopted into Latin as logica, which means the art or science of reasoning. On the other hand, in terms of terminology, logic is the systematic study of valid inference and correct reasoning. Therefore, it can be understood that when we study logic, what we are learning is how to evaluate things rationally and systematically to reach a solid understanding and draw a sound conclusion. One striking statement about logic comes from the philosopher John Locke, who said that “logic is the anatomy of thought.” In this metaphorical statement, we can also understand that by studying logic, we are essentially learning about the structure of thought itself.

## 2. Logic in History  

### 2.1. Philosophical revolution

In this era, humans began to think not only about how to live in their environment, but also about themselves, truth, and ideas. One figure whose statement represents this revolution is [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), with his famous quote: “The unexamined life is not worth living.”. To understand the systematic development of logic, we can follow the stages of history below:

#### 2.1.1. Pre-Aristotelian Era

In this era, humans tried to understand the world through myth, narratives shaped by imagination and traditional constructions. Thinkers of this era include:

a) [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus)

He believed the world originated from water. This was considered rational at the time and reflected the knowledge of that era, water was everywhere. Thales is often regarded as the first philosopher and the first to consider the problem of the one and the many. This concept is still relevant today, as we see that everything, despite its many forms, shares common substances.

b) [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander)

Anaximander questioned Thales’ idea: If everything comes from water, then where does water come from? He introduced the idea of the Apeiron (the indefinite/infinite), beginning the philosophical search for a first principle (archê).

c) [Xenophanes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes)

As humans began to question truth and divinity, Xenophanes criticized anthropomorphic portrayals of gods. Here, monotheistic ideas began to appear.

d) [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus)

Famous for the quote: “You cannot step into the same river twice.” He believed everything is in constant flux, reality is constant change. He introduced the concept of Logos as the rational structure behind the universe, implying that nature can be understood through patterns. He also introduced dialectical thinking: things are defined by their opposites, a foundation for binary thinking. 

e) [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides)

Opposing Heraclitus, Parmenides argued that opinions do not necessarily reflect truth. In his view: What is, is; what is not, is not. Truth lies in existence, while change is an illusion.

f) [Zeno](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea)

In the realm of logic, Zeno can be considered one of the first figures to raise the issue of the relationship between logic and sensory data. He questioned: Which should we trust, logic or what we see? One of his most famous arguments is the Achilles and the Tortoise paradox.

In short, in the story, the swift Achilles agrees to give the slower tortoise a head start in a race. However, Zeno argues that, logically, Achilles will never be able to catch up with the tortoise. The reasoning is as follows: every time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise previously was, the tortoise has already moved a bit farther ahead. To reach this new point, Achilles must again travel a slightly smaller distance, and so on, infinitely. As a result, according to Zeno’s logic, Achilles will always remain behind, even if only slightly. This clearly contradicts our sensory experience, as in reality we can observe that Achilles would easily overtake the tortoise. However, logically and mathematically, Zeno’s argument forms a paradox that is difficult to refute within the boundaries of formal logic.

This paradox became one of the earliest indications of the debate about how we should treat mathematical logic: Is syntax (formal structure) more important than semantics (the meaning or reality we observe)? In this way, Zeno raises an important question about the limits and role of logic in explaining reality.

f) [Plato](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)

Known for distinguishing between the world of ideas and the actual world. He believed that numbers and mathematical concepts do not exist in the physical world, but in the world of forms (ideas).

Through the early history of the philosophical revolution, we realize that even in the contemporary era, humans are still driven by the same fundamental questions.
a. Aren’t we still asking the same things today, about the origin of the universe?
b. Aren’t we still questioning what is the source of all matter?
c. Aren’t we still contemplating binary concepts, such as only knowing that something is true because something else is false, and vice versa?

And isn’t it true that through the development of mathematical logic, paradoxes arise not from reality itself, but from our conceptual frameworks? The Pre-Aristotelian questions were clearly questions that mostly belonged to the transcendental realm. Thus, when entering the Aristotelian era, these transcendental questions began to be addressed in a more rational manner, by developing a system of thinking focused on what can be observed by humans.

#### 2.1.2. Aristotelian era

   In short, [Aristotle](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristoteles) is regarded as the Father of Logic, primarily because he developed a system of categories, which classifies everything. Specifically, these categories are: Substance (Ousia), Quantity (Poson), Quality (Poion), Relation (Pros ti), Place (Pou), Time (Pote), Position (Keisthai), State (Echein), Action (Poiein), and Passion (Paschein).He is also well known for his method of syllogistic reasoning, for example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. This is one of the most famous examples when first learning about syllogistic logic. In addition, Aristotle is recognized as someone who developed a system of reasoning that also aimed to understand fallacies within arguments.

### 2.2. Modern era  

   In the modern era, the development of logic can be understood in three main points:

a) Enlightenment 

During the Enlightenment, philosophy grew in popularity, especially in terms of rationality, scientific methods, and freedom of thought. Philosophers and mathematicians like [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), and [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) began developing more systematic and reflective approaches to logic, emphasizing reason as the means to acquire knowledge.

b) 19 Century 

“Logic” experienced a revolution. Thinkers such as [George Boole](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), [Augustus De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan), and [Gottlob Frege](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) developed symbolic and mathematical logic, which was far more precise than traditional Aristotelian logic. Frege introduced predicate logic, leading to non-classical logic.[ Georg Cantor](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) founded set theory, now a foundation of modern mathematics. The dominant school of thought: Logicism, which holds that mathematics can be reduced to logic.

c) 20 Century

“Logic” continued to grow and was applied in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science. This era saw the emergence of modal logic and its branches, such as:

1) Alethic logic  
2) Deontic logic  
3) Epistemic logic  
4) Doxastic logic
5) Temporal logic
6) Dynamic logic
7) Action logic
8) Intuitionistic logic
9) Multi-modal logic
10) Provability logic

Meanwhile, mathematics faced a foundational crisis, initiated by [Kurt Gödel](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del). Where the 19th century saw Logicism, the 20th century saw new “isms”:
   
1) Formalism: Logic is symbol manipulation based on formal rules.
2) Intuitionism: Mathematical truths are mental constructions.
