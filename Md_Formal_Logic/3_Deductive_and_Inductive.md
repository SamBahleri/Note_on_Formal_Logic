# Deductive and Inductive

## 1. Deductive

In terms of etymology, the word “deductive” comes from the Latin verb deducere, which means “to lead down or away.” This reflects the process of reasoning from general principles to specific conclusions. Moreover, in terms of terminology, specifically in logic and philosophy, deductive reasoning refers to a method of reasoning that moves from general premises to specific conclusions. We have already seen this in the Introduction material. In short, deductive reasoning is a form of reasoning based on necessity. If we list them out, several of the topics below involve forms of reasoning or conclusions that are necessarily true.

1. Logic

    As we have seen in the Introduction material, a statement is a declaration that contains truth, whether it is true or false. Specifically, if the premises are false, then the conclusion will also be untrue; and conversely, if the premises are true, then the deduction must be valid. In this case, the conclusion is vital.

    Example:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{All humans are living beings} \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{Socrates is a human} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, Socrates is a living being}
    \end{aligned}
    $

    Example:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{If } A, \text{ then } B \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & A \text{ occurs} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, } B \text{ occurs}
    \end{aligned}
    $

2. Definition

    Deductive reasoning can also be observed through definitions.

    Example:

    1. Truth is truth.

    2. All triangles are flat shapes with three sides.

    3. A bachelor is an adult man who is not married.

3. Sylogistic

    As we’ve seen in the Introduction material, syllogistic reasoning is reasoning where the conclusion is necessarily true due to elements such as categories (living beings) and definitions.

    Example:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{All humans are living beings} \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{Socrates is a human} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, Socrates is a living being}
    \end{aligned}
    $

## 2. Inductive

In terms of etymology, the word “inductive” comes from the Latin verb inducere, meaning “to lead into” or “to bring in.” This reflects the process of reasoning that moves from specific observations or examples toward general conclusions or principles. Furthermore, in terms of terminology, inductive reasoning refers to a method of reasoning in which generalizations are formed based on repeated observations or patterns. We have also seen this form of reasoning in the Introduction material, specifically in the section on informal logic. In short, inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning based on probability. If we were to list them, several topics below are forms of reasoning or conclusions that are probabilistic in nature.

1. Logic

    Although inductive reasoning is frequently associated with informal logic or arguments lacking rigid formal structure, in practice, formal logical structures, such as modus ponens, can also be used in inductive reasoning, depending on the content of the premises.
    Example (Modus Ponens):

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{If Paul studies hard, then he will be accepted into a university} \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{Paul studies hard} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, he will be accepted into a university}
    \end{aligned}
    $

    Structurally, this argument takes the form of modus ponens, which is a deductive form. However, the first premise does not deliver logical certainty, but rather a high probability based on past experience or generalization. Thus, while the form is deductive, the content is inductive, meaning the conclusion is not guaranteed, only probable. This shows that inductive reasoning doesn’t have to be informal; it can take a formal structure, as long as the truth of the premises is not absolute.

2. Analogy

    One common type of inductive reasoning is reasoning by analogy. In this form, one concludes that because two things share some similarities, they may also share other characteristics. A famous example is the “watchmaker analogy” used by William Paley to support the argument for the existence of God as the designer of the universe.

    Form of Reasoning:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{A watch, with its complexity and order, shows evidence of being designed by a watchmaker} \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{The universe also shows similar complexity and order} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, the universe is also likely designed by a creator/designer}
    \end{aligned}
    $

    This kind of reasoning is clearly inductive, because it is based on probability. As stated above, just because two things share some features does not necessarily mean they share all features. Such reasoning, while it may sound convincing, is often considered a weak argument.

3. Generalization

    Generalization is a type of inductive reasoning characterized by drawing conclusions from only a few instances or observations.

    Example:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Premise 1:} \ & \text{Swan A is white} \\
    \text{Premise 2:} \ & \text{Swan B is white} \\
    \text{Premise 3:} \ & \text{Swan C is white} \\
    \text{Conclusion:} \ & \text{Therefore, all swans are white}
    \end{aligned}
    $

4. Causation

    Although the law of causality feels intuitively persuasive and is widely used in everyday life and science, it is actually a form of inductive reasoning, for several reasons:

      1) Causality is based on experience and repeated observation of specific patterns.

          The philosopher David Hume is well-known for this view. He reasoned that we never directly experience causality; instead, we only observe that one event regularly follows another. In other words, what we perceive as a causal relationship is merely a constant conjunction of events. Therefore, the link we presume between cause and effect is just a habit of the mind, not something objectively featured of reality.

      2) Causality assumes the consistency of nature, or that the future will resemble the past.

          For instance, we believe the sun will rise tomorrow because it has always risen in the past. But this belief is based purely on past experience, not on any inherent truth about the universe itself. Hence, causal reasoning is practically a prediction rooted in experience, and therefore, it is inductive.

## 3. Deduction vs/and Induction

Comprehending this fundamental difference is crucial when producing formal statements, specifically, as we've studied in the distinction between formal and informal logic. Regarding what we call “true”, formal logic focuses on the form of the argument, while informal logic focuses on the content of the argument. In this context, deductive reasoning is typically formal, whereas inductive reasoning is generally informal. In practice, however, a conclusion should be evaluated not only based on the form of the argument, but also on the truth of the premises and the relevance of the content (whether the premises correspond to reality). Therefore, we cannot rely solely on the rigid rules we have constructed; we must also take into account our actual experience of reality. Furthermore, apprehending deduction and induction is vital for clearly clarifying the boundaries between what is logically true or false and what is empirically valid or not.

Deductive rules give us logical assurance, since the method is predetermined, conclusions follow necessarily from the premises. Induction, on the other hand, offers probability based on experience. It is also essential to acknowledge that deductive rules are the result of human consensus, agreements we have made, whereas induction reflects reality itself. In other words, we comprehend phenomena only to the extent that we can perceive and interpret them. We assemble patterns to the degree that they can be applied, even if we do not fully understand the underlying reality. This marks the epistemological limits of human knowledge. Essentially, both approaches are equally fundamental, because it is through both that humans can adapt to reality.
